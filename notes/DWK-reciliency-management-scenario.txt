to desgin an reseiliency managemtn system. 

basically if somethng technical cuases the system to go down we want to make sure that
we are able to the application can recover as quickly as possible 

technology recovnery action plan 

componet loss site loss and cyber malwar attack

fo non crytical application ther one scenario is iste loss



RTO reconvery time objective 
BIA business impact assessment 
TRAP techonology recovery action plan 



need to design the resiliency management system for the un only 

MoSCow technique - Must have, Should have, Could have, Would have 


system requirements
General  functinality 

login system for the application, operate and resiliency team stuff

acess to the sesiliency manegemtn system requiring login in

system must record: application name, application ID, RTO, primary location,
alternate location, application staff allocated and operate staff
allocated.


####################################################

i could probably save the information as a dictinary of dictionary 
#####################################################


application records msut allow TRAP documents to be attached or removed

#########################################################

i could use like pointers

for example attaching a document simpley means adding a value which point to where 
the actual TRAP document is 
removing this value is the same as dettaching the document 

#########################################################

application records when a material chanfe has occurred on an application
and a date to when this change happened 

testing records must record : date, scenario, data centre or standalone test type,
duration, source location, target location, test result and testing evidence to be
recorded. 

testing records within the system where the test duration is greater than the RTO must be
marked as a fail.

the system shoual allow reporting on data center events results

###################################################################

this could be some sort of report function that goes though all the tests classifies the 
taskes on weather the failed succeeded. there should also show the test persoformed

###################################################################

the system could have a help function for new users




role based functionality 
ability fo perfoem a number of actions which depends on the staff members system role


application entries

an application must be assinged a RTO bsed on a BIA 

an application must have at least two applicationteam members and two operattion team 
members assinged to it at point of creation 

an application must have a TRP  approval recorded against it in the last twelve months

an application should have a a TRP approval recorded against it following 
the indication that a materal chage has occured 

an application TRap documents shoudl have an indicator as to whcih scenario the TRAP covers 
whilst the most critical application should have all scenaros included in the documenst,
non-critial apps can also inculde scenarios that are not required 


testing entries 

Only one testing scenario per day for a given application 

for a test to ve tesing compliant it requires the application to have a successful test 
for each scenaro determined by criticality for the last twelve months

when a testing record enty is shown as completd is must update the application 
entry primary and DR location appropriately

########################################################################
i think this means that it needs to update the primary site and the DR sites
#######################################################################
to be testing compliant an application should have the most recent test for
each scenario be successful. the testing scenarios applicable are tedetmined
by criticality (see Appendix a p)

when a testing record entry is recorded as failed then testing compliance should be 
removed from the application 



Reporting Functionality 
the system must be able to produce reports as an excel file
####################################################################################
need to find a libary that can make excel files

need to formart the report such the the excel file looks correct

this could be done using one function.
##################################################################################

excel files generated from the system should allow for data manipulation
##################################################################################
need more explanation 
##################################################################################

the system should be able to run a report based on slected date range 
#################################################################################
need to make sure that i have a consistant dating formart thought the whole thing
#################################################################################

all members of the resiliency team must be able to run reports out of the system for 
all application in the systems :
	must be able to run a report showing details about all application entries
	must be able to runa  report showing details abouttesing records
	must be able to runa report showing testing compliance status
	shoudl be able to runa report shoing TRAP approval comliance status
	could be able to run a report showing re-testing due dates

all members of the application and operat teams should be able to run reports 
out of the system for all application entreis that they are associated with:'
	shoud be able to run a report showing details about all their application entries
	should be able to run a report showing details about all their testing records
	could be able to run a report showing all their testin complaince status




APPENDIX B 
Testing Scenarios
component loss - loss of any one server withina singel data centre. plan covers all tiers

site loss - loss of a data centre. plan must cover moving processing rto alternate site

cyber malware attakc - loss of ll infrastructure in all data centers. plan must 
covert receatuing application from bare metal, recovering data and returning
processing to BAU


APPENDIX C 
TRAPs for each applicatioon deplyment will be created and maintained in system
for each application 

Details of planning content for technology recovery action plan for each application

roles and responsiblilies of recovery personnel 
infrastruture component associated witht eh application 
sofware ( operatin system , ulilites, application programs)
detailed recovery step including activies, step,surations,key person,dependencies,
componet dependancies, and required supporting documnetaion that will enable recovery of 
IT services to nroal production operation. 









things to keep in mind 
for the final product an actual database could be used rather than just a cvs or whatever
shit i use






questions ?
what is a metiral change ? 
does data minipulation in the excel file mean changes to the actual database ?
